An interactive choose-your-own-adventure narrative.

Welcome to my README on Donnie's Dungeon!


Notes about my game (can also be found in my .py file, at the top in comments):

This was created using Spyder 3.3.2, and thus would best be run via that environment

Total number of questions in the entire game (not including first question that starts game): 48

Number of questions in "winning" pathway: 20
Pathway to take to win (not including first question that starts game):

A, B, yes, a, a, a, no, no, yes, b, b, a, b, b, a, b, b, b, b, a (or) b


Interesting pathways you can take to collect items, play a game or two, and ultimately meet the wizard (other than the "winning" pathway):

Interesting Path #1 (only takes you up to meeting the wizard): 

10 questions (not including first question that starts game);

a, a, a, a, a, a, yes, a, a, yes


Interesting Path #2 (only takes you up to meeting the wizard):

10 questions (not including first question that starts game);

b, yes(+), a, b, b, b, b, b, a, yes

(+) = leads to a game that you must win in order to progress on this pathway


Interesting Path #3 (only takes you up to meeting the wizard):

10 questions (not including first question that starts game);

c, a, b, a, b, b, a, no, b, no



Thank you for reading!
